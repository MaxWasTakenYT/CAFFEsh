# â˜•CAFFEsh
A shell enhancer, worse than [fish-shell](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell) and also [bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/)

## ðŸ“’Compiling
I personally recommend you to use the [installer]() which is (probably) easier, but you can also compile it yourself using `gcc`
* If you are using `gcc` to compile CAFFEsh, you'll need to parse the `-lstdc++` option (e.g. `gcc -o caffesh caffesh.cpp -lstdc++`)
* Remember to give the executable permissions after compiling: `chmod +x ./caffesh`
