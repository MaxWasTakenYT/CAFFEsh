# ☕CAFFEsh
A shell enhancer, worse than both [fish-shell](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell) and [bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/)

## 📒How to make yourself a CAFFEsh
I personally recommend you to use the [installer](https://github.com/MaxWasTakenYT/CAFFEsh/raw/refs/heads/main/get-csh) which is (probably) easier, you can also compile the installer yourself using `gcc`
### 🍵Installing with `get-Csh` / Pros
* You won't ever need to update `get-Csh` since it downloads files from the repository
* If there's an update for `CAFFEsh`, you can click install it in two clicks, without breaking anything

### 🤓Compiling yourself / Pros
* Not many actually, you waste a bit of time too
#### 😖Compiling yourself / Notes
* If you are using `gcc` to compile CAFFEsh, you'll need to parse the `-lstdc++` option (e.g. `gcc -o caffesh caffesh.cpp -lstdc++`)
* Remember to give the executable permissions after compiling: `chmod +x ./caffesh`
